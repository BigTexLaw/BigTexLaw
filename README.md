- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BigTexLaw. 
Most of you know me from being active in the AVAX ecosystem discords and from Twitter. 
I am a community manager over at Yeti Finance and a member of Trader Joe's Cultivation Committee. 
Since going balls deep into the AVAX eco, my creativity has skyrocketed and I am learning about new an interesting use cases in crypto. 
This inspired me to form a team to launch BetSki, the first betting protocol to ever launch on AVAX.
